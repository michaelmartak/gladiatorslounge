What is the Gladiators' Lounge?

The Problem: I want to build a new deck for a Collectible Card Game!

Unfortunately...the resources to do so are spread over many different sites.  Each site has its own specialty (e.g.,
inventory, marketplace, strategy, search...).  Each site requires its own credentials.  And user interfaces...well,
many leave a lot to be desired.

Enter: the Gladiators' Lounge, an open source effort to consolidate those resources, with an effort geared towards getting
the user interface right first!

With a little bit of elbow grease, we can get there.
